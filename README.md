# Azure Infrastructure Operations Project: Deploying a scalable IaaS web server in Azure

### Introduction
For this project, you will write a Packer template and a Terraform template to deploy a customizable, scalable web server in Azure.

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository

2. Create your infrastructure as code

3. Update this README to reflect how someone would use your code.

### Dependencies
1. Create an [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com) 
2. Install the [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
3. Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads)
4. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Instructions
In order to build virtual machines from packer image using terraform on Azure you need to have
1. Azure Account
2. Install Packer
3.Install Terraform
4. A text editor
After you install the abpve tools and created your Azure account clone this repo, open Power shell or Bash
and navigate to the directory containing the main.tf, vars.tf 
1. run  packer build server.json (command takes a template and runs all the builds within it in order to generate a set of artifacts)
2.List the resulting image  az image list --resource-group images --output table (Display the images built from packer template and other available builts)
3.To deploy your Virtual machine run 
3.1 Terraform init (is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files)
3.2 Terraform Plan (is used to create an execution plan,the optional -out argument can be used to save the generated plan to a file for later execution)
3.3 Terraform apply (is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.)
### Output
our packer and terraform template will allow to build custom Virtual machines as required.
We can customize the vars.tf and main.tf inorder to control variable parametrs such as location,number of VMs,
password, username etc.Input variables are usually defined by stating a name, type and a default value.
The values defined in the vars.tf files can be used in the Terraform plans to avoid hard-coding parameters.
After running the packer build we will get our custom virtual machine image.And by runniung 
terraform plan you can deploy your virtual machine to Azure.
